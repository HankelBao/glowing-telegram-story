Poppy was a small dog. She had black fur, with some white and brown on her
tummy, legs, and head. She lived with her owner, a witch, in a hollowed out
tree in a misty forest. Her owner, although a witch, was retired from evil 
and spent most of her days knitting and baking cookies for the forest gnomes
and gremlins. Poppy loved her owner very much and always accompanied her on
her hikes through the forest.
